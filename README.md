Android VR Game? App? that shows cube of **Misaka Mikoto**s. That's it!

Download this beauty in apk file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timingsniper/MisakaMikotoCube_VR/main/MisakaCube.apk).

Made with Unity editor 2019.3 and Google Cardboard API, so this will work best with a Cardboard(-ish) VR goggle. Took a whole day to make, how efficient!

This is basically all that you'll see!

...That's really it here, this is the first Unity app ever made by myself, so I'm leaving my marks here to celebrate this symbolic moment lel

***btw, Misaka Mikoto best girl <3***
